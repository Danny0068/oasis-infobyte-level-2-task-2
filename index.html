  <h1>Alan Turing</h1>
  <p id="date">June 23,1912 - June 7,1954</p>

  <div class="box2">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Alan Turing (1912-1954) was a British mathematician, logician, and computer scientist who made significant contributions to the fields of computer science, artificial intelligence, and code-breaking during World War II. He is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of modern computing.</p>

  <div class="box3">
  <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
  <p>Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in London, England. He displayed exceptional mathematical talent from an early age. He studied at the University of Cambridge, where he excelled in mathematics.</p>

  <div class="box4">
  <h2>Code-breaking during World War II</h2>
  <p>During World War II, Turing worked at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's code-breaking center. He played a crucial role in deciphering German Enigma machine codes, which provided invaluable intelligence to the Allies and is believed to have shortened the war.</p>

  <h2>Turing Machine</h2>
  <p>In 1936, Turing introduced the concept of the "Turing Machine." It was a theoretical device that could simulate any computer algorithm, laying the foundation for the modern idea of a general-purpose computer. This concept formed the basis of modern computing and computational theory.</p>

  <div class="box6">
  <h2>Turing Test</h2>
  <p>In 1950, Turing proposed the "Turing Test" as a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. The test involves a human evaluator interacting with a machine and determining whether the responses are from a human or a machine. The Turing Test has been influential in the development of artificial intelligence.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box7">
  <h2>Persecution and Legacy</h2>
  <p>Tragically, Turing faced persecution due to his homosexuality, which was criminalized in the UK at the time. He was convicted of "gross indecency" in 1952 and subjected to hormone therapy as an alternative to imprisonment. Turing died by suicide in 1954. It was not until 2009 that he received a posthumous royal pardon, and his contributions to science and society began to receive wider recognition.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box8">
  <h2>Impact on Computing and AI</h2>
  <p>Turing's work laid the groundwork for the development of modern computers and the field of artificial intelligence. His ideas have revolutionized the way we think about computation, algorithms, and machine intelligence. Turing's concepts and theories continue to shape the IT industry and inspire advancements in computer science and AI research.</p>
